Hi!!!👋
My name is Will and I am coding from Mauritius 🇲🇺🏖️😎
I just completed the Le Wagon Web Development bootcamp and started my career as a freelancer🤓 so if you need a website, do not hesitate to get in touch!👌
As a team, we are currently working on our first job: a real estate website that will serve as a proof of concept for a bigger project🤫.
Before coding, I studied marketing and entrepreneurship and innovation✨. 
I worked in advertising for 3 years,🎁
I opened an e-learning startup.👨‍🏫
I Connected 🚛 suppliers of AI solutions to Mauritian customers 🇲🇺👨‍💻 - that did not really work 😅 because in 2017 the algos of ML were not good enough 🔐 to work on such tiny quantities of data that we have on our paradisiac but terribly small island.💾🌴🥥 - Also... If you are a developer and endured lockdown🤪, you may think about Mauritius as your destination to code in the sun💻🌴🔆🏖️. If that is the case, do not hesitate to get in touch and I'll see what I can do ;)
